Trello is a simple Kanban tool I use to organize my life. It helps me:

- know all the things I need to do.
- helps me do it efficiently.
- maintains a history of everything I have done for future reference.
- help me be extremely organized in everything I do.

I use Trello for almost everything: Writing Blogposts, Traveling, Goals, Learning Tasks, Notes, etc.

If you are new to Trello, I recommend you [watch a video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/l3F3l3psqXY?si=JRes4P_YLCh6f7K1&amp;start=12) and [create a simple Trello board]((https://trello.com/ankushchoubey/recommend)) before reading this post.

## Optimizing Trello for Maximum Productivity

Trello/Kanban can scale to our needs. If you are getting started a simple setup maybe enough. But as time passes, and you get more productive, you'll find you need to [optimize your system for scale] (TODO: Link To Post) else the system starts choking.

Here are a few things I've done to optimize my Trello system:

- **Board Structure**: A well-organized board helps me focus on what needs to be done right now and ensures I complete tasks fully.
- **Card Structure**: Capturing all necessary information in the card helps me execute tasks to the best of my ability.
- **Dashboard Board**: This board provides an overview of all tasks across multiple boards, helping me prioritize what's important.

By following these steps and continuously refining your system, you'll be able to maintain high productivity and stay organized.

## Board Structure

The goal of a good board structure is to help you be **extremely organized** and help you in what to do next.

The basic Trello structure includes the following columns:

- To Do
- Doing
- Done

![](https://www.bluecatreports.com/blog/trello-to-do-list/best-board-ever.png)

However, as you get more productive it's better to enhance each column by breaking each into multiple columns.

### **Enhancing the "To Do" Column**

Instead of having a single "To Do" column, consider splitting it into multiple columns to better prioritize tasks:

- **This Week**: Tasks you aim to complete this week. Initially, this column can help focus your efforts. As you refine your system, you may rely on it less.
- **Future Planning Columns**: Use multiple columns to prioritize upcoming tasks. This helps keep your current focus clear and your future tasks organized.

I organize my Trello board with the left section focused on current tasks and the right section for future planning and knowledge units. Here’s a breakdown of how I manage future planning columns based on different domains:

**Example: Blogging Board**

- **Needs Organization**: Ideas that need to be sorted and structured.
- **Needs Refinement**: Developed ideas that require further refinement.
- **Ready for Production**: Fully developed ideas ready to be executed.

When it's time to write a blog post, I simply pick a task from the "Ready for Production" column.

**Example: Travel Board**

- World Tour: Columns for planning an international trip.
- India: Columns for domestic travel plans.

**World Tour**

**Bharat**

**Tip: Using the MoSCoW Method**

If you're unsure how to categorize tasks in a new domain, try the MoSCoW method:

- **Must Do**: Essential tasks that need immediate attention.
- **Should Do**: Important tasks that should be done but are not critical.
- **Can Do**: Tasks that are nice to do but not urgent.
- **Won’t Do**: Tasks that are not necessary or relevant at the moment.

By customizing columns based on the specific domain, I can prioritize and manage tasks more effectively.

### **Enhancing the "Doing" Column**

A single doing column doesn't indicate how much you have progressed on a task. It's better to have multiple columns.

Initially, I used percentage completions (10% complete, 50% complete, ...), but it was challenging to measure progress accurately. It's better to have a named stage.

As with "To Do" columns split, it's better to develop it by domain.

**Example: Blogging Board**

- **Clarity**
- **Writing / Recording**
- **Self Proof Reading, Refinement and Review**
- **SEO / Promotion / Content Marketing**

![](/images/life-blog/how-i-use-trello/Trello-Blog-Doing.png)

Like with MosCow, my default for most boards is:

- **Planning and Research**: Tasks start here, involving initial research and planning.
- **Learning / Doing**: Active work on the task, including learning and execution.
- **Feedback and Debrief**: Review and gather feedback to refine the task.

**Example: Fitness Board**

- **Planning, Intellectual Learning and Physical Learning**
- **Repetition and Sets**
- **Feedback, Recording, and Debrief: What went well? What can be improved? Improve it / Learn**

This way, I know exactly what stage each task is in and what needs to be done next.

### **Enhancing the "Done" Column**

Completing a task often isn't as straightforward as marking it "done." We want to:

- maximize the outcome we get from a task
- ensure we complete it fully (nothing left.)

One of the characteristics of Narendra Modi is he follows through until the end. He would make sure he is monitoring things fully. And that is what we need to do to, we have to make sure all tasks are done till the end.

Here are a few columns I have divided "Done" into.

- **Debrief**
- **Chained Tasks**
- **Freezed / Auto Pilot**
- **Closes / X Ledger**

**Debrif Column**

The first step in optimizing learning after a task is to do a quick debrief.

Before *Done* I have a debrief column where I ask myself:

- What went well? (Written in the comment)
- What can be improved? (Written in the Debrief Tasks Checklist)

This way, I have captured my learning with the task which will enhance my future work.

If there are "Debrief Tasks" I'll more the card to "Chained Tasks" Columns

**Chained Tasks**

Chained Tasks means: "This task is complete, but there are other tasks that got created because of this task that are yet complete. So we can't mark this task as fully complete."

It's important to track these chained tasks to ensure nothing remains undone and everything is followed through to the end.

**Example: Blogpost**

In many of my blogposts including this once, you'll see TODO written. These are blogpost ideas I have related to the post I am currently writing. If a post I write has TODOs, I'll move it to "Chained Tasks" column. And they'll stay in **Chained Tasks** until All other Chained Tasks are Complete.

To manage chained tasks, I use a three-fold system:

- **Chained Column on the Board**: A dedicated column to track all chained tasks.
- **Checklist for Chained Tasks**: A checklist within the main task card to list all related subtasks.
- **Chained Label**: A label to easily identify and filter chained tasks across the board.

This system ensures that all tasks are completed fully and thoroughly, following through every detail until the end.

**Frozen / Delegated**

Sometimes,

- tasks are completed but need to be revisited later.
- Or while doing a task, you realize that the problem will autofix in a few days.
- Or you have delegated the task to someone else.

For such tasks, I use the "Frozen / Delegated" column. This helps in keeping track of tasks that are on hold but still need attention.

**Closed**

This is a simple column that denotes the task is done a task fully and closed. Meaning I don't have to do anything more on this.

Closed column gives me confidence on my productivity. And there it also has a subname: A Complete Ledger.

**Example of Closed Column on different boards**

- **Life Board**: "Closed / Karma Ledger"
- **Travel Board**: "Closed / Interesting Life Ledger"
- **Blogging Board**: "Closed / Thought Clarity Ledger"

Naming it this way has been helpful to me. (TODO: Blogpost on important of naming on human behavior)

**Summarizing Enhancing the "Done" Column**

By organizing the "Done" column into specific categories and maintaining a detailed system for chained tasks, you can ensure comprehensive task management and continuous improvement. And ensure nothing goes out of your mind.

### Enhancing Knowledge Capture (Unfinished Idea: TODO: Improve this aspect then write about it)

I don't have a very good insight into capturing long term ideas. For example, if I learnt something that I want to acess later.

There are some fundamental knowledge about any domain that are long term and that you would like to he reminded of.

For this, I have added column with such information.

For example my "Finance Flyway" board has these columns at the right

- **Monthly Spending**: A card per month for monthly spending
- **Money Goals**: All my financial goals regarding money.
- **Money Formulas**: Things like 50:30:20. Rule of 72 etc.
- **Money Mindset**: Repair over Buy. Protect Electronics. Think of Money as Value.
- **Trusted Entities**: Companies and People I trust
- **Bad Entities**: Companies and People I can't trust financially or maybe even personally.

I have more such columns in Finance Flyway. Software Development board also has multiple such columns related to different types of Technology (AWS, Astro, Java, Java Multithreading, etc) Other domains have less.

## Card Structure

In Trello, tasks are divided as cards.

### Ticket Template

![](/images/life-blog/how-i-use-trello/Ticket-Template.png)

### Breaking down Big Cards into Smaller Specific Cards

To tackle large tasks effectively, breaking them down into smaller, achievable tasks is essential.

Example: Launching a New Website
Consider the task of launching a new website. This can be broken down into several specific steps:

- Learning about website launches
- Signing up for a hosting service
- Defining the content
- Writing the content
- Designing the layout
- Testing the website
- Promoting the launch

**Benefits of Breaking Down Tasks**

By breaking down a big task into smaller steps, you can:

- **Improve Clarity**: Understand the task better and identify specific actions needed.
- **Enhance Manageability**: Make the task less overwhelming and more achievable.
- **Boost Motivation**: Experience a sense of accomplishment as you complete smaller tasks.

**Methods in Trello**

In Trello, you can break down tasks in two primary ways:

- **Cards**: Create individual cards for each sub-task. This is especially useful for tasks that span multiple weeks or months.
- **Checklists**: Use checklists within cards for more detailed breakdowns. This is ideal for complex tasks that have many smaller components.

Usually, if I have a task which is multiple months, I'll break it down into a bunch of smaller cards that I can take action on in about a week.

And for checklist it depends, I may not may not use checklist if the task itself it small. But if a task get's complex, I'll break it down to checklists.

## What tasks to pick?

What task to pick? The task which eliminates need for other tasks.

I try to pick tasks that are the most urgent 🚨 and important first. Then I'll pick a few non-urgent and important tasks.

Initially, I spent a lot of time picking mostly urgent tasks& important. Now it's mostly non-urgent and important.

Non-urgent important tasks are long term tasks. Things like Reading a Book. Implementing a new technique. Setting up my Financial Flywheel. Etc.

If I do these properly, these will free up more time in the future and eliminate all the other tasks.

I once such a task is complete, I'll mostly be deleting a lot of the smaller tasks. For example, I was someone who used to watch a lot of YouTube videos related to social skills and communication, etc. but once I went through therapy, incorporated it's lessons, I no longer needed to watch a lot of those videos. So I deleted them.

Similarly, I remember I had a huge list of "content" to watch. After completely listening to the Bhagwad Gita and incorporating it's lessons, I deleted about 40 cards and tasks. Doing one task well had eliminated 40 cards 🃏 and it still does.

Whenever something happens, I think I had learned something to deal with this type of problem, what was it? Then I try to recall. And if I can't recall correctly, I'll go into the card and read my notes. 🎶. And try to implement it in the next few days. #neverGoingBack

## More boards

I realized that more boards makes Trello really overwhelming. But by not having more boards, I was really missing out on productivity gains.

- Good planning
- Ultimately getting progress

I figured out there is no other way, I need to create more boards.

The way I did it was much more organic. I experimented with a few boards. And also deleted a few, for example, I realized Job board wasn't super useful for me because 90% of recruiters ghost and rest reply super late after a month or two. ⏰ . The cards on my Job Search board would remain stale.

So instead I started tracking only when I had passed the initial screening and was giving online tests.

Initially, I also had writing and all other tasks mixed into one board. This made it very overwhelming.

I started by separating Life and Writing. ✍️

Then I realized I need something for Development so I created one called DevLife.

These remained my main boards.

Later, I realized I needed ways to improve my health, so I started Body Board.

Then I thought I should also do things in life. I being someone who doesn't go out much. I think It'll be good to get out. Maybe watch shows etc. so I created Experiences board.

Tip is this: anything that is important to you, should be part of trello. If it's small you can keep less number of boards. But as you get more interested, you'll find it's better to split into a separate board.

Note depending on the domain, the speed at which cards move changes.

For example, Travel board tasks will be added over months but will be completed in a week when you actually go to travel. Most of the year you'll spend time planning your travel.

Similarly, Body board will have a lot of goals that take time

Finance Stories usually move faster. Finanial goal achievement is slower over months.

Etc etc. This gives you a satisfaction. You know everything is undercontrol and moving.

## Making board interesting to use. Images and Dashcards and changing names. #AutoLawOfAttraction

The board should be interesting and fun to use. Else you'll use it less and less. So this is an important step and you won't want to ignore it cuz it sounds cheesy.

There are a few ways to have an interesting board.

You can change the background image to something you like.

You can add images to cards. 🎴. I especially add images to my goal cards. 🎴

Add Dash-cards. Dash-cards is trello power-up that shows you quick count of number of things in a list or based on a certain criteria. I add dash-cards for any list that is significant.

- This week
- In progress
- Done
- Chained Task
- Quality Control
- Each idea column

Also I change the names of columns and boards when I find I am not using it much. For example my finance board had the following names over the months

- Money
- Paisa
- How money works
- Finance
- Financial Flyway (Current)

Changing names gives a new way of looking 👀 at the board. So I keep updating it iteratively.
