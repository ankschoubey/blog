title: We only see what we do badly because the reward of doing work well is just peace.
---

We don't see the benefits of doing something good until we do something poorly.

When we do something poorly, we feel pressure and have to go back and rework things. But when we do things properly, there is no reward.

The reward is just peace. And if you think about it, that's good.
