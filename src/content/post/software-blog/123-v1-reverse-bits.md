Get the last bit of value from the original. append to the reverse one. shift reverse one to the left. instead of adding, you can do `or` because after the shift last value will be 0. Imp - iterate 32 times only.

```java
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        int rev = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            rev = (rev << 1) + (n&1);
            n = n>>1;
        }
        return rev;
    }
```
