title: Web Development Tip - Reverse Engineer by looking at DOM
---

This is probably the most simple web development tip. I discovered this while trying to custom build a PDF annotation component.

I looked at Box.com and it's DOM through Chrome's developer tool.

That gave me a idea of how it might have been done.

That allowed to reverse engineer and build the annotation feature which worked when zooming in, out and adding new annotations.
