# Approaches

# O(n) time. O(1) space.

Similar to swapping two numbers. Start with prev as null and current and keep swapping next. Return prev because that's the last value.

[image]

```java
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode current = head;

        while(current!=null){
            ListNode tempCurrent = current.next;

            current.next = prev;
            prev = current;

            current = tempCurrent;
        }
        return prev;
    }
```
