title: Naming Convention for Indexes [Quick Read]

I learned this naming convention from Redux Documentation and Web Dev Cody on YouTube.

You can use this convention for

- Any database index
- Any time you want to create a map for quick retrieval

## "By" Convention

```java
by({fieldName}{sortOrder}{separatedByAnd})
```

## In Database

Suppose you have table movies and two MongoDB index

```json
{"movieId": 1}
{"movieId": 1, "country": 1, "releaseYear":-1}
```

Rather than having a naming convention like

```java
MovieIndex
MovieCompountIndex
```

Have a descriptive naming convention that starts with

```java
ByMovieId
ByMovieIdAndCountryAndReleaseYearDesc
```

You can use the same thing in SQL. Just use snake case instead of camel case.

```sql
by_movie_id
by_movie_id_and_country_and_release_year_desc
```

## In Redux

The same convention can be used to create custom indexes in things like Redux.

```json
movies: {
  byId: {

    ...

  },

  byMovieIdAndCountryAndReleaseYear:{

    "M-1:india:2024": { // Example

      ...

    },

    ...

  }

}
```

I'll explain how to create custom indexes in Redux in a later blog post [TODO].

## In Code

Within code, since a map is just an index,

```java
Map<String, Movie> byMovieId = ...;
Map<String, Movie> byMovieIdAndCountryAndReleaseYear = ...;
```

But for code, this may be too much.

If you think about it, this is very similar to the JPA naming convention.

**What naming convention do you use for creating indexes?**
