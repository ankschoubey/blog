Mutation Testing allows for finding missed assertions in test and  bugs in code. This is how it works:

- We write test against a piece of code.
- When the code changes, the test should fail.
- Mutation Testing changes the code a little and sees if our existing test fail. Each change is called a `mutant`.
- If the test fails, we say `mutant` is `killed`. This is good.
- If the test still passes, we say `mutant` `survived`. This is bad.
- Our aim is to reduce `survived` mutants.

This will ensure our code is bug free and our test is high quality.

## Setting PIT Mutation Testing for Java

To setup mutation testing for your Maven Multimodule project, this is how you can do it.

**Step 1**: Add the following to the `pom.xml` of the your module.

```xml
<plugins>
 <plugin>
  <groupId>org.pitest</groupId>
  <artifactId> pitest-maven</artifantId>
  <version>{check version info below}</version>
  <dependencies>
   <dependency>
   <groupId>org.pitest</groupId>
   <artifactId> pitest-junit5-plugin</artifantId>
   <version>{check version info below}</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependencies>

  <configuration>
   <targetClasses>
    <param>com.your.package.path.*<param>
   </targetClasses>
   <targetTests>
    <param>com.your.test.package.path.*<param>
   </targetTests>
   <excludeTestClasses>
 <param>com.your.test.package.path.*Integration*<param>
       </excludeTestClasses>
  </configuration>
 <plugin>

</plugins>
```

For version numbers checkout the following links:

- [pitest-maven on mvn repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.pitest/pitest-maven)
- [pitest-junit5-plugin on mvn repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.pitest/pitest-junit5-plugin)

**Step 2**: Skip all integration tests

Ensure that you don't run Integration Tests. The `excludeTestClasses` will help you filter them out.

I name add `Integration` to my Integration tests name so that it can be skipped with `*Integration*` pattern

**Step 3**: Ensure all your tests pass.

pitest won't run unless your test passes.

**Step 4**: Run `mvn install -DskipTests`

This will create bytecode files that `pitest` will read.  `-DskipTests` just skips running all the tests again.

**Step 5**: Run `mvn org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage`

If you want to run in a specific module, then you can add the module name in the end

`mvn org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage -pl {module-name}`

**Step 6**: Find the report in `/target/pit-reports/index.html`

**Step 7**: Open the `index.html` file in the browser.
