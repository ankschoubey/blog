Writing unit tests is a crucial part of software development, but how do we know if our tests are truly effective? Code coverage tools show which lines of code were executed, but they donâ€™t tell us if the tests are meaningful or catch real issues.

This is where Mutation Testing comes in. It introduces small changes to your code (called mutants) and checks if your tests detect them. If they donâ€™t, it means your test suite isnâ€™t strong enough!

In this guide, weâ€™ll walk through setting up PIT Mutation Testing in a multi-module Maven project, ensuring that your tests are as robust as possible.

## How mutation coverage works

Mutation Testing allows for finding missed assertions in test and  bugs in code. This is how it works:

- We write test against a piece of code.
- When the code changes, the test should fail.
- Mutation Testing changes the code a little and sees if our existing test fail. Each change is called a `mutant`.
- If the test fails, we say `mutant` is `killed`. This is good.
- If the test still passes, we say `mutant` `survived`. This is bad.
- Our aim is to reduce `survived` mutants.

```java
Original Code â†’ Modify Code (Mutant) â†’ Run Tests â†’ Pass? (Bad) / Fail? (Good)
```

This will ensure our code is bug free and our test is high quality.

## Setting PIT Mutation Testing for Java

To setup mutation testing for your Maven Multimodule project, this is how you can do it.

**Step 1**: Add the following to the `pom.xml` of the your module.

```xml
<plugins>
 <plugin>
  <groupId>org.pitest</groupId>
  <artifactId> pitest-maven</artifantId>
  <version>{check version info below}</version>
  <dependencies>
   <dependency>
   <groupId>org.pitest</groupId>
   <artifactId> pitest-junit5-plugin</artifantId>
   <version>{check version info below}</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependencies>

  <configuration>
   <targetClasses>
    <param>com.your.package.path.*<param>
   </targetClasses>
   <targetTests>
    <param>com.your.test.package.path.*<param>
   </targetTests>
   <excludeTestClasses>
 <param>com.your.test.package.path.*Integration*<param>
       </excludeTestClasses>
  </configuration>
 <plugin>

</plugins>
```

For version numbers checkout the following links:

- [pitest-maven on mvn repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.pitest/pitest-maven)
- [pitest-junit5-plugin on mvn repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.pitest/pitest-junit5-plugin)

**Step 2**: Skip all integration tests

Ensure that you don't run Integration Tests. The `excludeTestClasses` will help you filter them out.

I name add `Integration` to my Integration tests name so that it can be skipped with `*Integration*` pattern

**Step 3**: Ensure all your tests pass.

pitest won't run unless your test passes.

**Step 4**: Run `mvn install -DskipTests`

This will create bytecode files that `pitest` will read.  `-DskipTests` just skips running all the tests again.

**Step 5**: Run `mvn org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage`

If you want to run in a specific module, then you can add the module name in the end

`mvn org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage -pl {module-name}`

**Step 6**: Find the report in `/target/pit-reports/index.html`

**Step 7**: Open the `index.html` file in the browser.

## Final Thoughts

Mutation Testing is an excellent way to validate the effectiveness of your test suite. Unlike traditional code coverage, it doesnâ€™t just tell you which lines of code were executed but also checks if your tests are strong enough to detect actual code changes.

By integrating PIT Mutation Testing in your Maven multi-module project, you ensure that your tests provide real value, catching missed assertions and hidden bugs before they reach production.
