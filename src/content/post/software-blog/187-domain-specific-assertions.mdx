import Tip from '~/components/custom/Tip.astro';

Tests need to be as clean as the code we write. A clean test is faster to write, easier to understand, debug, maintainable, and extensible.

Personally, I see more care applied to code than tests. When I write new tests in a Test file that lacks specific encapsulations, I mostly spend 3-4 times more time writing tests and still being under-confident about the tests.

Like clean code, writing clean tests requires an initial investment in setting up the test infrastructure. Some of these techniques I have talked about before:

- [method/when/then pattern](/method-when-should/)
- encapsulated [tests data creation with factory methods](/test-data-factories) or builder (I prefer builders now)
- [in-memory database for faster test](in-memory-repositories-unit-test/)

Apart from these, there are some patterns I have implemented which I'll talk about in the upcoming blog posts:

- Custom Mocks and Custom Bean Decorators for Tests (‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• TODO)
- Encapsulating WireMock / Mock Server (‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• TODO)
- Easy Random for Quick Data Generator (‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• TODO)
- Custom Extensions for JUnit (‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• TODO)
- Testing Red Flag: Too many acts. Too Many Assertions. (‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• TODO)

This blog post will talk about Domain Specific Assertions which will extend the blogpost on [Fluent Assertions](/software-blog/fluent-assertions) I wrote a while back.

```java
blog DomainSpecifAssertions extends FluentAssertions üôÉ
```

## Introducing Domain Specific Assertions

When using AssertJ or any other testing library we typically get some value from expected and get some value from actual and try to match them.

**Example**:

```java
// 64 characters
assertThat(movie.getName()).isEqualTo(expectedMovie.getName());
```

And we may have some assertions which are repeated often.

For **example**, suppose we always assert the actor names something like this.

```java
var actors = movie.getActor().stream().map(a -> a.getName()).toList();
assertThat(actors).contains(‚ÄùTom Cruize‚Äù);
// 113 characters
```

Typically we create a helper method to help us assert. However, the typical way of making a helper method makes it complicated.

Luckily, AssertJ provides an [AbstractAssert](https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/core/api/org/assertj/core/api/AbstractAssert.html) class that can be extended to create Domain Specific Assertions that can look something like this:

```java
assertThat(movie)
 .hasName(expectedMovie.getName())
 .hasActorWithName(‚ÄùTom Cruize‚Äù);
// 86 characters
```

## Implementation

Use this implementation or use the LLM prompt I have provided in the next section.

### Step 1. Create a class that extends `AbstractAssert`

```java
class MovieAssert extends AbstractAssert<MovieAssert, Movie> {
   public MovieAssert(Movie actual){
    super(actual, MovieAssert.class);
 }

 public MovieAssert hasName(String expectedName){
  if(!expectedName.equals(actual.getName())){
   failWithMessage("Expected movie anme to be %s but was %s", name, actual.getName());
 }
  return this;
 }

 public MovieAssert hasActorWithName(String actorName){
  var actors = movie.getActor().stream().map(a -> a.getName()).toList();
  if(!actors.contains(actorName)){
   failWithMessage("Expected movie anme to be %s but was %s", name, actual.getName());
 }
 }

 ... more methods here...

 The more complex your assertions are, the better it is to encapsulate them within a method here.
}
```

  type="note"
/>

## Step 2. Create a base class and add an `assertThat` method

```java
class BaseAssertions extends Assertions {

 public MovieAssert assertThat(Movie movie){
  return new MovieAssert(movie)
 }

 ... add other Domain Specific Assertions here ...
}
```

## Step 3. Extend base class

```java
class MovieTest extends BaseAssertions{

 @Test
 void addActor_shouldAddActorToMovie(){
  // given
  Movie movie = new TestMovieBuilder().build();

  // when
  movie.addActor("NTR Jr");

  // then
  assertThat(movie)
 .hasActorWithName("NTR Jr")
 ... other methods ...
 }
}
```

<Tip
  content="<b>Something to think about: How you'd do this in other languages</b><br><ul><li>I think such a thing is also easy to create in typescript.</li><li>You just need to extend check the type and return the right value.</li></ul>"
  type="tip"
/>

## Step 4. Optional: Create a custom base class

You can create a base class out of common patterns of assertions. Assume the following method in a base class.

```java
<T> void assertObjectEquals(String fieldName, T actual, T expected){
  boolean isEqual = Objects.equals(actual, expected);
  if(!isEqual){
       failWithMessage("Expected %s to be %s but was %s", fieldName, expected, actual);
 }
}
```

This way most of your Domain Specific Assertion class will just delegate to their methods in your parent class.

Here are some that I think can be added:

- `booleanEquals(String fieldName, Boolean object, Boolean object)`
- `isNull(String fieldName, T object)`
- `notNull(String fieldName, T object)`
- `listContains(String fieldName, Collection<T> collection, T object)`

## What to generate Domain Specific Assertions

You can generate these domain-specific assertions for all things you assert which typically include:

- entities
- response classes
- value objects

## Autogenerating Domain-Specific Assertions

There are two ways to auto-generate these domain-specific assertions.

1. Using LLMs like GitHub Copilot
2. Using [AssertJ Assertions generator](https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/assertj-assertions-generator.html)

- currently does not work with Java 17. They plan to launch a newer version soon.

For generating with LLM you can use the following prompt. Add more details to it as needed.

````java
## Task

Generate Domain Specific Assertions

## Details:

Generate a domain-specific assertion for this class for AssertJ. Extend AbstractAssert.

For each field in the source ensure these methods exist in the assertion class.

has{fieldName}() - if this method is present
notHas{fieldname} - fieldName not present
has{fieldName}(value) -> compare value

For fields that are other tables add another method that takes UUID.

has{fieldName}(UUID id) then compare by field.getId() with the id passed

Make sure to use String formatting.

Make use of the following base interface.

```java
interface DomainSpecificAssertionHelper {
  default <T> void assertObjectEquals(String fieldName, T actual, T expected){
    boolean isEqual = Objects.equals(actual, expected);
    if(!isEqual){
         failWithMessage("Expected %s to be %s but was %s", fieldName, expected, actual);
 }
 }
}
````

This can help you create a skeleton. But you'll need to add the custom methods if your assertions are complex.

## Recap

- Writing a clean test is as important as writing clean code.
- We can write cleaner assertions by creating our own domain-specific assertion
- To create domain-specific assertion for AssertJ

1.  Create a class that extends `AbstractAssert`
2.  Create a base class with the `assertThat` method which will create our Domain Specific assertion class
3.  Extend your test class with the base class and use

- Instead of writing the code yourself, use an LLM to generate the code for you.
  - Or look out for the release of a newer version of [AssertJ assertions generator](https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/assertj-assertions-generator.html)

Look out for more blog posts coming in the future.
