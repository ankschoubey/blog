[I believe in Continuous Delivery. What you are see]

-- Background & Introduction & My expectations before the hackethon --

I participated in an AI Hackethon at my current workspace ([Real Brokerage: REAX](https://www.joinreal.com)) in June 2025.

As Claude Code and other AI tools are coming up, we needed to be updated on it. The leadership at the company decided it would be good to have a Hackethon as a way for employees to understand what the current state of Agentic AI is.

I had used Cursor before, and I expected Claude Code to have a similar performance. I also expectated, Claude Code to get stuck at some parts and that I would have to jump in.

## Planning for the Hackethon

### Deciding on Idea
The goal of the challenge was to try to build something big that we would not usually code up and this was communicated. So, I thought maybe making a video game would be a good idea!

I have never created a video game before. So this would be a real challenge

### Refinine the Idea

I asked Claude Web to create me a desktop game. And it did create a few games. Those were very simple 2D games which I liked.

TODO: Link to games here.

I showed it to one of my collegue who suggested to me to add computer generated sound. And it did. 

I also

-- Conclusion --

It has been more than a month since I participated in an AI hackethon at my current workpace ([Real Brokerage: REAX](https://www.joinreal.com)).

Participating in my first AI Haathon has taught me a lot of skills that I did not think you are possible. I think we are close to being the operator of agents than being the agent’s that write a court.
Before the Hackathon
• Tools you used
• Typical flow
• Mindset

I knew the Decathlon will be fast, therefore, I prepared myself by:

• Coming up with a plan of how I'm going to tackle the Hackethon.
• Bookmarking tools that would help me speed up
• Creating a plan, optimise for speed
• Doing simple validations to see if my idea would work

The goal of the head was to push and do something bold which I tried to do.

My idea of the haathon was to create an AI generated zombie survival game.

Before the hackethon, I was clean on what my idea was. I talked to Claude and did a quick prototype to understand the boundaries of it.

I also experimenting with adding different things to the site. 

This experiment also helped me understand the boundaries of what claude can do and also realized where it went wrong. 

While showing this prototype a friend/collegue suggested adding sounds which claud did.

I also decided to skip backend entirely and focus only on the frontend to speed up deployment.

Also, I realized I would have to type a lot. To speed up. I decided to voice dictation, which would help me speed up dramatically. I set voice dictation up to the key double press on my computer.

I had also read and listen to a few podcasts and blogs where I had of handedly gained some information:
• agents can work in parallel
• you can write things in a file and drag the file into LLM

So, before the hackethon I was prepared with:
• an idea that I had potential POC
• bookmark to quickly deploy on vercel
• a plan for how I am going to do it.
• etc
After the Hackathon
• What's changed in how you code?
• What Claude added? What Cursor lacked?
• Multi-agent thinking: how did it emerge?
Developer Systems I Built
• Prompt directory
• Dictation
• Chrome + Claude rapid test loop
• Claude for PRDs → Plans → Prompts
Final Thoughts
• What worked well?
• What surprised you?
• What would you reuse next time?
