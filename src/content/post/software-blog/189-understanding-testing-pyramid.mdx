## What is a Test Pyramid and Why is it important?

A good test pyramid ensures that our tests are fast.

Typically, we have 3 main types of tests

1. **Unit**: Involves testing only a particular method / class
2. **Integration**: Involves multiple components
3. **E2E**: Either done API down or UI down

There are some hybrids called slice testing in the middle.

Our aim should be to that the

- `Number of Unit Test` > `Number of Integration Test` > `Number of E2E`

This is because Unit Tests are the fastest. Integration Tests are a slower and E2E are the slowest.

Ideally, a test suite should complete in under 3-5 minutes to maintain developer focus and agility. Going beyond it, we lose our attention span and things pile up.

An ideal test pyramid looks like this:

```java
▲  End-to-End (E2E) Tests  (~5-10%)
▲▲  Integration Tests      (~30-40%)
▲▲▲  Unit Tests            (~50-60%)
```

Below, I describe some ways with which I have been ensuring a good test pyramid.

## How I ensure a good test pyramid?

The following describes backend approach for ensuring good test pyramid. But similar can be extrapolated for frontend.

### **Entities** -> Unit Tested

Entities are the foundation of your domain logic, and their behaviors should be thoroughly unit tested to ensure correctness and maintainability. Since entities should be self-contained and encapsulate business rules, they do not require integration tests.

- **Ensure Entities Are Non-Anemic** → Entities should encapsulate behavior, not just data. Anemic models lead to bloated service layers and weaker domain modeling.
- **No Integration Tests Needed** → Entities should not rely on external dependencies like databases or services.
- **Use Test{Entity}Builder for Reusability** → A builder pattern simplifies test setup and ensures consistency across multiple test cases.

### **Service/Handlers**

1. If Repository methods and API Clients are simple
   1. Covers next **30-40%** tests
   2. Unit Test: [Hashmap-based InMemoryRepositories](/software-blog/in-memory-repositories-unit-test)
      1. Reduces mock usage. Makes writing tests simpler
   3. Mocked API Clients
2. If Repository methods are complex (customQuery/criteria Api)
   1. Integration Test with DB and actual API call. (5-10% of all tests)

### **API clients**

from another microservice is integration tested

### **Architecture Testing**

Anything architectural is also tested mostly with [ArchUnit](https://www.ankushchoubey.com/software-blog/architecture-testing)

### **#Failure-Driven Testing**

Any failures on Staging / Prod will have a new test written

### Bonus Tip: **Automate Code Review Learnings**

Any code review point that is syntactical goes to a knowledge base for future automation

## Ending

A well-balanced Testing Pyramid ensures fast feedback, reliable software, and efficient development cycles. Prioritizing unit tests keeps execution times low, while integration and E2E tests catch cross-component issues.

By adopting in-memory repositories, failure-driven testing, and automation, developers can accelerate test execution while maintaining high software quality.
