I try to optimize my workflows so that I can do things at a speed of thinking.

These are my optimizations for Team City. Similar features can be found in other tools.

**Note**: I could not share images of my workflow because I use TeamCity at work. I have added some pictures that found on the internet.

## Install Team City Chrome Extension for Notifications

This allows for notification when the build succeeds or fails. This has been a big time saver for me. I can run a job in the background and let myself work on another task freely. As soon as the task is done, I will get a notification. Before, I would have to recheck it a few times and often I would completely forget about it.

**Note**: you'd need to configure Team City so that you'd have you'd receive a notification.

**Also** ensure your browser notifications are on.

You could also do email notification but it'd get cluttered fast.

## Bookmark Favorite Builds page

This will allow you to quickly see the builds that you run.

If you want to get notifications for something you haven't run, click the ⭐ star icon next to the build. This adds it to your favorites and you'll start receiving notifications for it.

## Fuzzy Search to Launch Builds Fast

You can use quick search by using `Cmd + K` or just `Q`. And then you can search with initial phrases instead of typing the whole thing.

Suppose you want to search `Movie Microservice Test`, typing just `mo mi te` will filter and bring it to the top. You can click enter and run.

## Running the build quickly

TeamCity does not offer a quick shortcut to run a build once we are on a page. For this, I created a custom shortcut using the [Shortcuts Chrome Plugin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/shortkeys-custom-keyboard/logpjaacgmcbpdkdchjiaagddngobkck?hl=en):

```javascript
Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('button[aria-label]'))
 .find(el => el.getAttribute('aria-label')?.toLowerCase().includes('Run'))?.focus();
```

Once focused I click `Enter`.

## Looking at dependent builds with the Dependencies view

TeamCity and other tools allow viewing related dependencies in a single view.

For example, if `Build 1` depends on `Build 2`, then you can see the progress of both on one screen.

For TeamCity:

- Go in the "Run".
- Click on "Dependencies".
- Click on "Chain".
- Optional: Click on details for more details.

This will allow you to easily see all the steps in the chain from one view.

## Conclusion

Watching over CI build can be tedious. Using the above tips can help you improve your workflow by a huge margin. While the examples above are in TeamCity, you can replicate it with any tool of your choice.
