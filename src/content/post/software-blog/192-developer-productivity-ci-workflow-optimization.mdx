I try to optimize my workflows so that I can do things at a speed of thought, where your tools feel like extensions of your mind, not blockers.

These are my optimizations for CI monitoring. I currently use Team City but I believe similar features can be found in other CI tools.

**Note**: I could not share images of my workflow because I use TeamCity at work. I have added some pictures that found on the internet.

## Workflow

### Install Team City Chrome Extension for Notifications

This allows for notification when the build succeeds or fails. This has been a big time saver for me recently where I can run a job in the background and let myself work on another task freely. As soon as the task is done, I will get a notification.

Personally, it has helped me reduce stress and it has increased my productivity because

- I can start a build and leave it in the background while I do other tasks.
- I will get a notification as soon as the task is complete vs I remember if I had put a task up and going and rechecking a few times. This means that I take action on it as soon as it succeeds or fails.

**Note**: you'd need to configure Team City so that you'd have you'd receive a notification.

**Also** ensure your browser notifications are on.

You could also do email notification but it'd get cluttered fast.

### Bookmark Favorite Builds page

This will allow you to quickly see the builds that you run.

If you want to monitor and get notifications for something you haven't run, click the ⭐ star icon next to the build which adds it to your favorites and you'll start receiving notifications for it.

### Fuzzy Search to Launch Builds Fast

You can use quick search by using `Cmd + K` or just `Q`. And then you can search with initial phrases instead of typing the whole thing.

Suppose you want to search `Movie Microservice Test`, typing just `mo mi te` will filter and bring it to the top. You can click enter and run.

### Running the build quickly

TeamCity does not offer a quick shortcut to run a build once we are on a page. For this, I created a custom shortcut using the [Shortcuts Chrome Plugin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/shortkeys-custom-keyboard/logpjaacgmcbpdkdchjiaagddngobkck?hl=en)

```javascript
Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('button[aria-label]'))
 .find(el => el.getAttribute('aria-label')?.toLowerCase().includes('Run'))?.focus();
```

Once focused I click `Enter`.

### Looking at dependent builds with the Dependencies view

TeamCity and many other CI tools view related dependencies in a single view.

For example, if `Build 1` depends on `Build 2`, then you can see the progress of both on one screen.

For TeamCity,

- Go in the "Run"
- Click on "Dependencies"
- Click on "Chain"
- Optional: Click on details for more details

This will allow you to easily see all the steps in the chain from one view.

## Conclusion

Watching over CI build can be tedious. Using the above tips can help you improve your CI workflow by a huge margin. While the examples above are with Team City, you can replicate it with any CI of your choice if you understand the intent.
