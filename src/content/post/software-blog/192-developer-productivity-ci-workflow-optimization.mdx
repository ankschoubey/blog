I try to optimize my workflows in such a way that I can do things at a speed-of-thought.

This is my optimizations for CI monitoring. I currently use Team City but I believe similar features can be found in other CI tools.

## Workflow

### Install Team City Chrome Extension for Notifications

This allows for notification when build succeeds or fails. This has been a big time saver for me recently where I can run a job in the background and let myself work on another task freely. As soon as the task is done, I will get a notification.

Personally, it has helped me reduced stress and it has increased my productivity because

- I can start a build and leave it in the background while I do other tasks.
- I will get a notification as soon as the task is complete vs me remembering if I had put a task up and going and rechecking a few times. This means as I take action on it as soon as it succeeds or fails.

**Note**: you'd need to configure Team City so that you'd have you'd receive a notification.

**also** ensure your browser notifications are on.

you could also do email notification but it'd get cluttered fast.

### Bookmark the favourite runs page

Bookmark the favorite runs page: This will allow you to quickly see the builds that you run.

If you want to monitor and get notification for something you haven't run, you'd get a star icon next to the build which add it to your favorites and you'll start receiving notification for it.

### Using Quick Search

You can use quick search by using `Cmd + K` or just `Q`. And then you can search with initial phrases instead of typicing the whole thing

Suppose you want to search `Movie Microservice Test`, typing just `mo mi te` will filter and bring it to the top. You can click enter and the run.

- [ ] I need to find a way to run with button click.

### Running the build quickly

TeamCity does not offer a quick shortcut to run a build once we are on a page. For this, I created my own shortcut using the [Shortcuts Chrome Plugin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/shortkeys-custom-keyboard/logpjaacgmcbpdkdchjiaagddngobkck?hl=en)

```javascript
Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('button[aria-label]'))
  .find(el => el.getAttribute('aria-label')?.toLowerCase().includes('Run'))?.focus();
```

Once focused I click `Enter`.

### Looking at dependent builds with Dependencies view

TeamCity and many other CI tools offer showing related dependencies.

For example, if Build1 depends on Build 2. Then you can see the progress of both in one screen.

## Conclusion

Watching over CI build can be tedius. Using the above tips can help you improve your CI workflow by a huge margin. While the examples above are with Team City, you can replicate it with any CI of your choice if you understand the intent.
