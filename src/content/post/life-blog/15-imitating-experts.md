Imitate after you have a firm base to understand what and why they are doing something.

Experts have a hard time explaining things they have internalized.

Trying to copy them at-least initially will likely lower your confidence and make you wanna skip and go home and sleep.

People on YouTube have a “perfect execution” and they usually don’t show how much work goes behind it. A way to look behind their work is to look at them performing Live or streaming Live.

For programmers, it can be helpful to look at GitHub commits too.
