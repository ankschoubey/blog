## Capitalism

Money is a proof that you're adding value to the world. [^1]

The more you earn, the better it is for everyone.

Plus, you need money to provide for yourself and your family.

## New domains, people and environment

New environments and people give you new perspectives.

As a programmer, we need can work in different business domains. If you are getting bored by your domain.

## Interviews keep you sharp and help you know your progress

Even if you are not going to jump companies, interviews will keep you sharp.

In capitalism, free market decides your worth, interviewing is like calculating your credit score.

## You don't owe people anything

Move to place where you get better opportunities/resources. You don't need to be at a single place.
