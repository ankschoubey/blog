There are some assumptions that I have found useful when dealing with my own biases.

## 1. Assume you don't know something or you are not good and need to practice regularly.

Eg: Assume you don't know how to meditate like a Yogi. Assume to learn you need to sit and practice. [^1]

## 2. If you know a lot about a problem & that problem has existed for a long time -> Assume you do not know enough or have been thinking wrong. Try/seek new things you haven't tried before.

In medical field, it's common to assume the problem is X. We start treatment of X but that doesn't solve the problem. The doctor re-adjusts their hypothesis and try out new tests etc. Once the right problem is recognized problem is solved instantly.

Eg: If you have tried one way a few times and the problem is still there. Try another way.

## 3. If you are crying, assume you are sad and need to take care.

This came up during my depressive phase. I did not know what was going on. And so, I used this and some other clues as guidance.

## 4. If you are addicted to something & you are going somewhere near. Assume you have a high probability of getting stuck there and so don't gooo.

## 5. Assume the person you are talking to knows something you don't. Talk with them in a way that helps you understand them.

## 6. Assume there is something you can do to improve your situation/problem/eetc. 

If you are stuck, assume you don't know. Cuz once you know the problem is solved.

Most problems are problems of not knowing or assuming knowing. once you are truely understood, (ngyaan) you are free. So, try to understand things from different perspectives, until you reach that understanding.

## 7. Software development: Assume deployment on friday will lead to work on monday. Don't deploy on fridays.

At EOD, assume you are bad at decision making at night. And so, sit on things and wait till morning.

If you are angry, tired. assume the same.

Assume deployment of Friday will make you work on weekends. Don't deploy on friday.

## 8. If your house/room/computer/phone is not cleaned and organized, clean and organize it. Assume, it will help you be productive and it is a blocker.
