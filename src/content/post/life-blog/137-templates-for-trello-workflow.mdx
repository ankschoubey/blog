My [previous post](/life-blog/how-i-use-trello/) presented my Trello board structure and card structure. This post will describe the template for text content inside those cards.

## The Quest for Clarity

I used to have a problem. My Trello cards would stall. They'd move from "To Do" to "Doing" and then... just sit there. The root cause? A lack of clarity. I often didn't know exactly what the next step was, or why I was even doing the task in the first place.

"Finding clarity" is easier said than done. It's not something you find; it's something you create.

That's when I started building thinking frameworks for myself—a set of templates to guide me at each stage of a task. Each template provides a mental model that has helped me shift my perspective and bring focus to my work.

The result is a simple, 3-step workflow that helps me understand what to do, why I'm doing it, and how to get it done: **Arrange, Act, and Assert.**

## The Templates: My Mental Toolkit

I've created a template for each stage of my workflow. I use a text expander tool ([Raycast](https://www.raycast.com)) to quickly insert them into my Trello cards using simple shortcuts (like `gg` for Grand Goal).

Here they are, arranged by the sequence I use them in my workflow.

### 1. Arrange: Setting Up for Success

This is the planning stage. The goal is to define the task, its purpose, and its boundaries before I start working.

#### Grand Goal (gg): Defining the "Why"

Every task, or "Grand Goal" as I call it, needs a clear purpose. This template forces me to focus on the *outcome* or *value* first, before I even think about the task itself.

**Format:**
```
{value/outcome} → {verb}: {what} - {context}
```

**Example:**
```
A clearer writing process → document: my Trello templates - in a new blog post
```

By starting with the "why," I can easily adapt my approach if needed. If a task no longer serves its intended value, I can deprioritize it without hesitation.

#### Easy Entry (ee): Scoping the "What"

This template goes into the Trello card's description. It expands on the "why" and sets clear boundaries for the task, defining what "done" looks like.

**Format:**
```
## Getting In

{Intention / Context or Constraint / Outcome Sketch}

## Done When

{Success Condition / Testable Trigger / Observable Output / Point of Closure}
```

This helps me avoid scope creep and gives me a clear finish line to aim for.

### 2. Act: Doing the Work

With a clear plan, it's time to execute. These templates help me break down the work and track my progress.

#### Small Steps (ss): The Power of Checklists

I use "Small Steps" for my checklist items inside a Trello card. The key is to make them small, specific, and actionable.

**Format:**
```
verb: {what} - {context in form of with/if/where/in}
```

**Example:**
```
write: notes on "Claude Code: Beginner’s Guide" - in Day One app in 30m
```
Vague tasks are paralyzing. Small, precise steps are empowering.

#### Conventional Comment (cc): Tracking Progress

This is where it all started. I needed a simple, consistent way to leave comments on my cards. This format makes it easy to scan through a card's history.

**Format:**
```
{type}: {comment}
```

**Example:**
```
progress: Talked to Steve Jobs. Found out he is working on a similar AI product.
```
I only comment when necessary to avoid clutter.

### 3. Assert: Learning and Improving

Once a task is done, the work isn't over. The "Assert" stage is about reflection and learning.

#### Relaxed Reflection (rr): Debriefing for Growth

I use this template in the card's comments during my debrief. The goal is to capture insights that will help me improve my process for next time.

**Format:**
```
## Relaxed Reflections

### Observations
(Liked - Learned - Lacked - Longed For)

### Recall Wastes
(Defects - OverProduction - Waiting - UnusedTalent - Transportation - Inventory - Motion - ExtraProcessing)

### Next Time
- {cursor}
```

The 'Recall Wastes' section is based on the DOWNTIME acronym, representing the 8 Wastes of Lean manufacturing.

This structured reflection helps me identify what went well and where I can be more efficient.

### What If I Get Stuck?

Even with the best-laid plans, sometimes a card just doesn't move. For those moments, I have a special template.

#### Flow Finder (ff): A Tool for Unblocking Myself

I use this template in the comments to diagnose why a task is stalled. I've only needed it a few times, but it's been incredibly effective.

**Format:**
```
## Flow Finding

### Objective

#### I want to...

#### But I am not doing this because...

### Diagnosis

#### Tiredness
#### Anxiety
#### Confusion
#### Boredom
#### Distraction
#### Treatment
```

It's a quick way to perform some self-coaching and get back on track.

## Conclusion

These templates are more than just text snippets; they are thinking tools. They bring clarity to my work by helping me define the why (`Grand Goal`, `Easy Entry`), the what (`Easy Entry`, `Small Steps`), and the how (`Small Steps`). They also provide a framework for tracking progress (`Conventional Comment`), overcoming blocks (`Flow Finder`), and continuous learning (`Relaxed Reflection`).

Since implementing this system, I've seen a significant improvement in my productivity and a dramatic reduction in the mental overhead of managing my tasks.

I encourage you to try these templates or create your own that fit your working style. A text expander like [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) can make using them effortless.
