In a previous post, I presented how I use Trello. The post covered a common column structure and common workflows.

This post expands on that and covers some text snippets that I use.

## Why Templates?

While working I found, that the more clarity that I have the better the cards move.

‚ÄúFinding Clarity‚Äù is a big term and I would not know if I found clarity until I complete the task.

So, I thought I needed thinking frameworks that can get me closer to clarity.

And that‚Äôs when I started creating and using these templates. Each template has had a unique shift in mindset that helps at that particular stage.

In the end, I have more clarity of what to do in each stage of my 3 step workflow (arrange, act, assert)

## Templates / Mental Models

These are arranged according to most usefulness and not according to sequence they are used.

1. Small Step - ss
2. Grand Goal - gg
3. Conventional Comment - cc
4. Relaxed Reflection - rr
5. Easy Entry - ee
6. Flow Finder - ff

(The repeated characters like ss above are the keyboard shortcut I have setup in Raycast).

### Small Steps - ss

Small steps are what I call my checklist items.

They are intentionally written in a way that they are a small step.

each small step has the following syntax.

```
verb: {what} - {context in form of with/if/where/in}
```

Example

```
write: notes on ‚ÄúClaude Code: Beginner‚Äôs Guide‚Äù - in Day One app in 30m
```

Before small step, my tasks would be vague, after small step, my tasks are much more exact.

### Grand Goal (gg)

I sometimes forget and say good goal. but means the same thing. Grand Goal is what I call each card in my Trello setup.

Each card is a new undertaking and therefore is grand.

The grand is suppose to emphase the reason behind why I am doing a task.

While small steps are clear action, they are not focused on the why. Grand goals are focused on the why.

Format

```
{value/outcome} ‚Üí {verb}: {what} - {context in form of with/if/where/in}
```

or you could think of as starting with value followed by the step format

```
{value/outcome} ‚Üí {step format}
```

Eg:

```
30%+ productivity ‚Üí learning: VIM motions - by watching YouTube videos
```

Now I know exactly why I am doing something.

The format emphasises focus on value/outcome rather than the specific task.

I found that when I wrote the task before value/outcome, I would do tasks for wrong reason and make tasks less flexible. but by having value/why focus early I can adapt my approach and even deprioritize cards early if needed.

### Conventional Comment cc

This is what started the journey of templatizing all stuff.

Conventional comments is a common format for comments during code review which is aimed and making writing comments easier.

```
{type}: {comment}
```

Example:

```
progress: talk to Steve Jobs. Found out that he is working on a similar AI product
```

Note: I don't comment on my cards if there is no needed.

### Relaxed Reflection

Relaxed Reflection is what I use during the Debrief/assert stage.

I want to gather as much insights from what I did and use it the next time.

```
## Relaxed Reflections

### Observations
{argument name="Liked - Learned - Lacked - Longed For"}

### Recall Wastes
{argument name="Defects - OverProduction - Waiting - UnusedTalent - Transportation - Inventory - Motion - ExtraProcessing"}

### Next Time
- {cursor}
```

### Easy Entry ee

```
## Getting In

{argument name="Getting In (Intention / Context or Constraint / Outcome Sketch)"}

## Done When

{argument name="Done When (Success Condition / Testable Trigger /  Observable Output / Point of Closure)"}
```

### Flow Finder

```
## Flow Finding

### Objective

#### I want to

#### But I am not doing this because

### Diagnosis

#### Tiredness
#### Anxiety
#### Confusion
#### Boredom
#### Distraction
#### Treatment
```

## Conclusion

There are more microsteps I do in my work.

For example, I want to work on tasks iteratively. And the way I do it is by using 2 thinking frameworks which I call FUEL üöÄ &  QUAK ü¶Ü.

Also, I use a script that pulls in Trello data in an arranged format so that I work on the most important task first.

I‚Äôll share this in next post.
